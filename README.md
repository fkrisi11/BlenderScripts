# BlenderScripts
Blender scripts I made, that I found useful enough to share

Currently available:

<h2>Addons</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Auto Orbit Selection:</b> Auto-enables Orbit Selection when an object is selected, disables it otherwise
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Better Hide:</b> Changes how the H key works in object mode. H now toggles between hidden / unhidden. H twice hides all selected items.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Vertex Group Cleaner:</b> Deletes all vertex groups from the selected meshes, that are not in use
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Save Reminder:</b> Reminds you with an on-screen text if you haven't saved in a while, after a user-defined time
  </li>
</ul>
